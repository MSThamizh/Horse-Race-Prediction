# Horse Race Outcome Prediction

## Problem Statement
The primary objective of this project is to predict horse race outcomes and identify significant features contributing to these outcomes. The key components include:
- **Data Retrieval**: Collect and preprocess historical horse race data.
- **Feature Engineering**: Create and transform input features to enhance model predictions.
- **Imbalanced Data Management**: Effectively address the imbalanced nature of race outcomes.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Develop classification models to predict outcomes such as "win" or "place."

## Workflow

### 1. Data Retrieval
- Collect historical horse race data, including:
  - Race features (track, weather, race distance, class, date).
  - Horse features (age, weight, past performance).
  - Jockey and trainer statistics.
  - Results (win, place).
  
### 2. Data Cleaning and Preparation
- Remove duplicates.
- Handle missing values using statistical methods like mean/median for numerical variables.
- Convert data types as required for machine learning models.

### 3. Feature Engineering
- Create new features such as:
  - `win_rate`, `avg_finishing_time`, `recent_form`.
  - Encode categorical variables (e.g., horse names, jockeys, race tracks) using one-hot encoding, label encoding, or ordinal encoding.
  
### 4. Imbalanced Data Management
- Apply techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), under-sampling, or class weights to handle class imbalance effectively.

### 5. Model Building
- Train multiple classification models:
  - Random Forest Classifier.
- Evaluate performance using:
  - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.
  - ROC-AUC.
- Use stratified k-fold validation and hyperparameter tuning (Grid Search, Random Search) to optimize model performance.
